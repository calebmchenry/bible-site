description: When it comes to relationships love is the bond of perfection. Here are four properties from 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 that stick out to me as keys to achieving this bond, patient, kind, not irritable, and not resentful. This chart categorizes these properties by whether love "is" or "is not" and if it is part of giving or receiving.

# Introduction

A couple things in my life provoked me recently to study this topic. One of which was I downloaded and listened to a [series](https://www.gettysburgchurchofchrist.org/sermons/?wpfc_sermon_series=the-greatest-of-these) of lessons about 1 Corinthians 13 from a guest speaker at the Gettysburg church of Christ. Another was that I recently learned a song where the lyrics were just the words from 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. After it got stuck in my head I was able to memorize these verses. I started looking at the relationships around me, including my own relationships, and using the properties found in these verses as a template.

I did some categorizing and I placed "patience", "kind", "not irritable", and "not resentful" in the category of "Love in Relationships."

If you look at the chart above I've placed "patient" and "not irritable" under the sub-category of how love receives. And I placed "kind" and "not resentful" under the sub-category of how love gives. I think those two sub-categories together sum up relationships quite nicely. The things you do or say to someone are all then received by that someone. And the reverse is true as well. We all decide when we give or receive whether we will do it in a bad or good way.

# How Love Receives

## Patient

Paul, while inspired by God, chose patience to be the first description of love and probably for good reason. It is easy to love someone if they love and do good to you as well. But according to Paul love is going to be patient. Which implies love will still love even when someone tries your patience. Jesus put it this way in **Luke 6:32-35**.

> <sup>32</sup> If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. <sup>33</sup> If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. <sup>34</sup> If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount. <sup>35</sup> But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.

How will we possibly be able to do _"kind to ungrateful and evil men"_ if we don't first endure and get past the mistreatment that we receive from them? The natural response would be to wish vengeance upon them. Our body tells us to be like James and John in **Luke 9:54** when the people of Samaritan village did not receive Jesus and His disciples.

> <sup>54</sup> And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, “Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" <sup>55</sup> But [Jesus] turned and rebuked them.

This doesn't really scream patience does it? But with the teaching of Jesus, John went from that person in the gospels to be the person later to write this is **1 John 4:20**.

> <sup>20</sup> If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.

We can get a closer glimpse of the teaching of Jesus during his sermon on the mount. In **Matthew 5:38-39** didn't Jesus say:

> <sup>38</sup> You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." <sup>39</sup> But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.

Imagine if you were the peron in this example. If someone were to slap you or to insult you, isn't our natural response to slap back harder or to come back with a wittier insult? When we are practicing love in our relationships we have to resist the natural impatience we have and learn to not only listen to what Jesus taught but to also follow His example. Didn't Jesus while in the hours before His death endure mocking, spitting, whipping, and slander? But Jesus did not lash back. Jesus had the power to _"command fire to come down from heaven and consume them."_ But instead He patiently endured the cross because the was what was best for the whole world.

People have tendency to barely suffer one another, let alone _long_ suffer one another.

## Not Irritable

Another description Paul uses is that love is not irritable. Doesn't that go hand in hand with patience? If you are in a state where you are easily angered how well do you think you will be able to practice patience?

The difficulty with not being irritable is people are irritating. If we were honest with ourselves there is always something we do that another would find irritating. For example, I tend to whistle and I do it often. To me and to perhaps others its no big deal or its even enjoyable, but to others it grinds their gears. If we can recognize that we ourselves irritate others then we will be more likely to not be irritable and endure the irritation others.

I think it is also important to point out the people closest to us tend to be those who we get irritated with the fastest. As evidence think about how often you hear about high school best friends becoming roommates and college and then driving each other crazy? Or you might hear the cliche "they fight like and old married couple." Or you could even think back to growing up with siblings, didn't they know exactly which buttons to push in order to drive you bonkers?

# How Love

After a brief look into how love receives in relationships, let's do a bit of digging into how love gives back in a relationship.

## Kind

One of the hardest things to do, as mentioned earlier, is to do good those who do bad things to you. Kindness is the reverse of patience. Have you ever thought of it that way? Where a patient person will endure bad things that happen to them, a kind person will do good things to others.

I don't know about you but when I think of kind I have a tendency to associate it with gentleness or being nice, but I am not sure gentleness or niceness is the idea Paul is trying to get across. As reference Jesus in **Revelation 3:19** made the statement _"those whom I love, I reprove and discipline."_ When a parent disciplines a child it may not be perceived as nice or gentle but rather mean. I think the word "kind" in 1 Corinthians is doing what is most beneficial and useful. Not disciplining or instructing a child on how to behave may seem like the peaceful thing to do at the time but is certainly not what is the most beneficial or useful thing for the child.

To drive home the point that kindness does not necessarily have to be associated with niceness or gentleness, imagine a mother and her small child are walking walking down the street of a large city. All of the sudden the child runs toward a busy street. What will the mother do? She will run, leap, dive, yank, tackle or do whatever is necessary to keep her child from being hit by a car. In that situation the kind thing to do did not involve being gentle.

Now lets transfer that idea to our spiritual relationships. If someone in the body of Christ is caught up in a sin, what is the kind thing to do? I think we can all agree the most useful and kind thing will be whatever causes them to repent. Take a look in **2 Thessalonians 3:13-15** and **1 Corinthians 5:18**, sometimes what God has instructed us to do with a person caught up in sin is tough. Some may even say it isn't right or nice. But faith is trusting in God that His instructions are what is most useful for someone. Here is Paul's encouragement in the aforementioned **2 Thessalonians 3:13**

> "As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good."

and similarly in **Galatians 6:9**

> "And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up."

Trust God that what He has described as being good will reap the reward of fruit in you and in the hearts of those you show God's love to.

## Not Resentful

Often times our ability to do good is hindered by the past. Isn't it natural to hold grudges and to resent those who have wronged us? To better understand more about the word resentful here in 1 Corinthians 13, let's look at different ways of translating it.

- Keeps no record of wrongs
- Does not recon
- Does not keep count
- Thinks no evil

If you are like me you may find that one of these is not like the other. the New King James Bible translates this section as _"thinks not evil."_ In reading that what comes to my mind is that love doesn't think about evil things like lying, cheating, greed, etc. But given the other translations I can better understand that it must mean that _"love thinks not evil [about other people]."_

A secular example of this word is what an accountant does. An account keeps a ledger of money coming and going out. An account keeps record, reconciles, and keeps count. That is fine when dealing with a business's bank account but in relationships love doesn't keep score.

How often do we have a tendency to keep track of the score board in our relationships? One might say "Well she wronged me in this way three times so it is no big deal that I did this one time." But love doesn't do that! Love is quick to forgive someone and to let the past go.

Who better to look at for an example of this than Jesus. When facing death because he was unjustly crucified He said in **Like 23:34** _"Father forgive them they know not what they do."_ That is love.

I could try and excuse my self and say Jesus is the Son of God. I can't forgive like He can. Fortunately for us we have another great example of someone having the spirit of forgiveness while being wronged. Stephen in **Acts 7:60** said _"Lord, do not hold this sin against them."_

# Conclusion

Could you imagine what church would be like if everyone in their relationships actively resisted irritation, impartially practice patience, always tried to do what was most useful, and showed the spirit of forgiveness when others fail.

All of us would benefit from compare our own relationships with the template of love Paul laid out for us in 1 Corinthians 13.

Glory to Jesus our Savior and great example of love. Amen.
