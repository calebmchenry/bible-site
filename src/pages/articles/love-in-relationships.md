description: When it comes to relationships love is the bond of perfection. Here are four properties from 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 that stick out to me as keys to achieving this bond, patient, kind, not irritable, and not resentful. This chart categorizes these properties by whether love "is" or "is not" and if it is part of giving or receiving.

# Introduction

A couple things in my life provoked me recently to study this topic. One of which was I downloaded and listened to a [series](https://www.gettysburgchurchofchrist.org/sermons/?wpfc_sermon_series=the-greatest-of-these) of lessons about 1 Corinthians 13 from a guest speaker at the Gettysburg Church of Christ. Another was that I recently learned a song where the words were just 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. After it got stuck in my head I was able to memorize these verses. I started looking the relationships around me, including the relationships I have in my life, and using the properties found in these verses as a template.

I did some categorizing and I placed "patience", kind, "not irritable", and "not resentful" in the category of "Love in Relationships."

If you look at the chart above I've placed "patient" and "not irritable" under the sub-category of how love receives. And I placed "kind" and "not resentful" under the sub-category of how love gives. I think those two sub-categories together sum up relationships quite nicely. The things you do or say to someone are all then received by that someone. And the reverse is true as well. We all decide when we give or receive whether we will do it in a bad or good way.

# How Love Receives

Paul, while inspired by God, chose patience to be the first description of love and probably for good reason. It is easy to love someone if they love and do good to you as well. But according to paul love is going to be patient. Which implies love will still love even when someone tries your patience. Jesus put it this way Luke 6:32-35.

> <sup>32</sup> If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. <sup>33</sup> If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. <sup>34</sup> If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount. <sup>35</sup> But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.

How will we possibly be able to do _"kind to ungrateful and evil men"_ if we don't first endure the mistreatment that we receive from them. The natural response would be to wish vengeance upon them. Our body tells us to be like James and John in Luke 9:54 when the people of Samaritan village did not receive Jesus and His disciples.

> <sup>54</sup> And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, “Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" <sup>55</sup> But [Jesus] turned and rebuked them.

With the teaching of Jesus, John went from that person in the gospels to be the person to write this is 1 John 4:20.

> <sup>20</sup> If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.

We can get a closer glimpse of the teaching of Jesus during his sermon on the mount. In Matthew 5:38-39 didn't Jesus say

> <sup>38</sup> You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." <sup>39</sup> But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.

If someone were to slap you or to insult you with words isn't the our natural response to slap back harder or to come back with a wittier insult? When we are practicing love in our relationships we have to resist natural impatience we have and learn to not only listen to what Jesus taught but to also follow His example. Didn't Jesus while in the hours before His death endure mocking, spitting, whipping, and slander? But Jesus did not lash back. Jesus had the power to "command fire to come down from heaven and consume them." But instead He patiently endured the cross because the was what was best for the whole world.
